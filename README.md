# TEC_exp
Matlab code to do IV sweep for thermionic energy conversion (TEC) devices while change the the interelectrode gap simultaneously.

The following instruments are controlled by the code:
1) SMU Keysight B2902A: for IV sweep
2) Vacuum actuator Thorlabs Z812V: for interelectrode gap variation
